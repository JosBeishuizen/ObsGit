  # Toespraak Peter
1 Glad that you could join us this week
2 The way you play, with all its strength and humour and devotion brings something about which helps us to make the best of our efforts. Your strength is growing every year. 
3 And so is our friendship as we are getting to know each other better and better 
4 Sad that these three days are ready over
5 But, there is a small present

Dark and cheerless is morn unaccompanied by thee
