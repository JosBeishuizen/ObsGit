# Toespraak Martin
1. We know you as a very energetic and dynamic conductor. It was 
2. As the ungodly we were used to his snares, fire and brimstone
3. But this year, no storm and tempest. Instead, you were considerate, encouraging, and even patient, of course not too patient.
4. As a consequence, we felt more confident, sometimes even relaxed, of course not too relaxed.
5. Many thanks for this week, your guidance, for leading us along all rocks and obstacles upon which we  are always stumbling. We learnt a lot from you and enjoyed this week very much.
