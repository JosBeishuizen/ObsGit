# Toespraak Peter
Nine years ago, in Salisbury, you joined us for the first time. Always since, including Florence, 10 times. This year again, these three days were joyful.

Great support during the rehearsals and during the services, for instance when we performed Caesars Mag & Nunc.

You often were able to to relax our serious efforts with a funny tune or intervention.

You also played in a very moving way, for instance when you played one of Bach's Leipzig chorals, or when you accompanied us when we sang Mathias' As Truly As God is Our Father.

Many inspiring moments during these three days, for which we are very grateful.

Strong resemblance between you and Martin In the way you both stress the importance of conveying the meaning of the text.

We very much look forward to next year when we visit your church in Chichester.
