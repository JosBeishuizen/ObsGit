Manuscript EDUREV-D-24-00247, entitled “Revisiting the research on teachers’ emotion regulation: A systematic review and future directions”, is focussed on analysing trends, methods, and theories in recent research on teachers’ emotion regulation (TER). The topic of this paper is interesting and relevant for the Journal. The paper is well structured and, in general, well written (some minor flaws can be easily repaired, perhaps with the help of a native speaker). So, the topic is interesting, the sample of papers looks promising, but, unfortunately, the content does not warrant publication. My advise is to reject the paper. My comments are the following.

1.  The paper lacks a theoretical framework which fuels the formulation of clear and answerable research questions. A review study is not a descriptive summary of a set of research papers but a theory inspired attempt to answer research questions. These are what Alexander (2020) called the “framing challenges”. I quote from Table 1 of her article: 1. Finding a “critical question” worthy of review, by situating the review theoretically, by demonstrating the merits of the review, and by considering the maturity of the field of inquiry. 2. Posing an unanswered but answerable critical question, by establishing what is already known and what needs to be known, and by articulating an answerable question. End of my quote of Alexander (“Methodological Guidance Paper: The Art and Science of Quality Systematic Reviews”, Rev. of Ed. Res, 90, 1,  6-23). The steps, outlined by Alexander, have not been taken in the current manuscript.

2. On p.7, the authors refer to two recent review studies, addressing the same topic as put forward in the current manuscript: Wang et al. (2023) and Aldrup et al. (2023). Unfortunately we are not made aware of the outcomes of their studies. Instead, the authors conclude: “However, the overall characteristics of existing TER research, such as the trends, methods, and theories used in previous studies remain underexplored.” Apparently, this is the focus of the current manuscript. That could have been made clear in the title. But the problem remains: there is no frame encompassing “trends, methods, and theories”. In their current form, the research questions: “(1) What are the trends and distribution of existing TER studies? (2) What research methodologies have been used in these TER studies? and (3) What theoretical frameworks have been adopted in these TER studies?”, can only lead to a summary of the content of the papers in the sample. There is no “unanswered but answerable critical question”.

3. Two examples illustrate my comments. First, the distribution in time of the selected papers. The authors emphasize that there “two periods, with 15 publications in Period I (2004-2014) and 161 in Period II (2015-2023)” (p 11/12). The conclusion may gain relevance against a background of the general distribution of research papers in, let’s say, the domain of emotion regulation research. So, the sharp increase might be reflected in this general trend, or might deviate from the trend. Then we have something to discuss. The same comment could be made about the distribution of papers over the various countries of origin. Does this distribution deviate from a more general trend? We definitely need these backgrounds in order to make sense of the findings reported in the current manuscript.

4. Emotional labor and emotional management are two concepts, together with emotion regulation, which may help to create a framework for further investigating the topic of the review study. The concepts have been explored in the two review studies mentioned above. However, in the current manuscript, they are briefly introduced in par. 2 (Literature Review) but do not play a major role in the manuscript. A deeper analysis of the concepts might inspire the authors to arrive at more compelling research questions.

5. Figure 5, explaining “Three theoretical categories of theories in TER studies” (p. 69) might indeed serve as a point of departure for the whole review study. Since there is no empirical basis for dividing the research themes, the categorization of research themes under three headings could have been accomplished without the review endeavour itself. Therefore, this division might serve as a point of departure for analysing questions addressing the choice of research methods in each of the three categories of TER theories.
