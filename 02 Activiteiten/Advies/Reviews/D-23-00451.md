Manuscript D-23-00451 provides the results of a review study into the use of microteaching or "rehearsals" in teacher education, particularly in "literacy methods course". The topic, although rather small in itself, may be valuable in the context of teacher education methods. Therefore, it is relevant for the Journal. The paper has been well designed and well written. The methods as well as the results have been clearly described. However, unfortunately I have advise negatively on the manuscript as a whole. 

The size of the review is small, both in content and number of reviewed papers (15). Apparently the domain of the review study has not been developed to such an extent that a review is warranted. As the authors themselves explain in the Discussion section (p. 22), "the majority of research included in this review was qualitative (73%) and exploratory in nature". Further on, "The focus of  the research questions and subsequent findings had little overlap across studies", "no firm conclusions can be drawn yet regarding the efficacy of rehearsals in literacy-based methods courses". On p. 26 the authors point to "the lack of clear terminology surrounding the use of rehearsals". Taken together the authors make clear the time for a substantial review has yet to come. 

Whenever the authors wish to work on the review, it would be wise to choose a theoretical framework as a basis for formulating research questions and interpreting the outcomes. The current research question on p. 7, "what are the characteristics of literacy-based rehearsal used in teacher preparation methods courses?" does not give any direction or focus to the review study. Activity theory might be a profitable basis to design a theoretical framework (see p. 15). It might be wise to focus either on elementary or on secondary education as classroom practices and interactions between teachers and students differ considerably, at least in the country and culture of this reviewer. The review study appears to focus on the US context (see p. 2). This makes the manuscript less relevant for readers and journals outside the US. Lastly, as a small comment, the authors are advised to consult the APA manual to arrive at a proper Abstract. The current one lacks important information regarding the background of the study and is too elaborate on some of the characteristics of the study.
