# D-24-00393
Manuscript D-24-00393 presents a scoping review in which views on the schools of the future are brought together. Considering what kind of education is needed in schools of the future is relevant and may help us to prepare for changing cultural conditions. Therefore, one can imagine that a review paper on this topic fits into the scope of the Journal. However, the current manuscript is a collection of ideas and views around four topics: supporting "glocal" (global and local) community connections and individual needs, agentic leadership, technology supported spaces, and reconceptualising education. These ideas and views are interesting and sometimes challenging but they are lacking an empirical or a theoretical basis which justifies the claims made. Therefore, I unfortunately suggest to reject the paper. 

It is difficult to further detail my problems with the paper. I do not see how the Bourdieu framework clarifies or organizes the claims. Apart from the often used term "capital", in this manuscript Bourdieu's theory does not put the various views in an overarching network which connects the ideas and gives them more theoretical strength. 

Any empirical underpinning of the claims is lacking, as far as I have understood the paper. My advise would be to find claims which have been proven to be useful and effective and explain what the practical value of these claims will be. Perhaps, such empirical underpinning cannot be found in the papers reviewed. Then, the authors might further explore and question this lacking empirical basis and might suggest ways to strengthen the claims put forward. 

Some claims are so abstract and general that lack any meaning, at least for this reviewer. For instance, on p. 2 the authors quote Vartiainen et al. (2020) that "schools are often preparing young people with skill sets that are not adequate for their future". I simply don't understand what this statement means. Which skill sets are referred to? What does "often" mean? Where is the empirical evidence which justifies this conclusion?

Many terms and concepts are introduced without properly explaining what they mean. For instance, on p. 22, it is stated that "The learning environment should utilise student-centred and flexible pedagogies" with references to quoted papers. As long as it is not explained what is meant by student-centered and flexible pedagogies, the claim does not help readers to prepare for the future. 

In my country, schools are facing serious problems, like deteriorating literacy and mathematical skills among students, severe social, even racial problems and contrasts, increasing inequality between the rich and the poor. None of these issues are seriously addressed in the papers which have been collected and reviewed. That does not disqualify the review as such. However, the authors might choose to question this apparent lack of attention in the papers they have collected. 

To sum up, my advise is to take a more critical stance towards the quality and content of the claims put forward in the collected papers. Issues like lacking empirical support or theoretical underpinning might be discussed. One quote on p. 23 struck me: 'Ertmer & Ottenbreit-Leftwich (2013) suggests caution, asking that we focus technology integration efforts on the “pedagogy that technology enables and supports, rather than the technology itself”'. Caution is really needed when claims of educational prophets are considered as proven and, consequently, put into practice.
