Manuscrip D-22-00513 presents a review study on the topic of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study focuses on learning processes and outcomes  in environments where online tools are used to communicatie between teacher and students. The paper is very well written. Concepts are clearly defined, the structure of the paper is appropriate. The topic of the review study is relevant for the Journal. However, my advice is to reject the paper. My main concern has to do with the lack of reflection on the collected data, which may have been caused by the relatively short time span between the review period and the moment at which the review study has been conducted. My comments are the following.

a. My main concern has to do with the fact that the review study has been insufficiently framed (Alexander, 2020). There is no theoretical context in which the review has been situated. Consequently, the first research question is too general: "What are the factors influencing the implementation of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, and what are the relationships between these factors?" Such a general question can only lead to general answers. 

b. Figure 5 is a thorough attempt to integrate the findings, but it illustrates that the authors did not succeed to accomplish this. Figure 5 does not highlight the main conclusions and, consequently, does not help the reader to understand the way online learning does take place with the help of digital learning tools. 

c. In the Results section ("Enablers and Barriers to Online Learning") data and conclusions are mixed up. Sometimes, figures are reported (e.g., 3.1.4. Usage continuance) but generally these figures are left out and only conclusions are reported: "Students found ...", "The majority of students had no previous ...", "self-efficacy positively influenced ...". It is difficult for the reader to figure out what the weight of these conclusions is, without knowledge about the data on which these conclusions have been based. 

d. The value of the Methodology section ("Research Methodologies") is not clear. The conclusions and assertions are rather general and not particularly focussed on studies into online learning. It is not clear what makes the methodologies to be adopted in these studies special.

e. The sample contains 56 studies in higher education (85%) and 10 studies in other domains of education. Because this distribution is very uneven and because online learning is quite different in higher education as compared with early childhood and primary/secondary education, it would preferable to focus the complete review on higher education, leaving out studies situated in other domains of education.
