# D-22-0030R2
My comments focus on the follow-up on my previous review on D-22-0030R1. 

1. As far as the comprehensive picture of the competences of bilingual education teachers is concerned, the authors mistook my suggestion to think as assessors of bilingual teaching competences for a recommendation to propose ingredients for such an assessment. My intention was to suggest ways to bring more focus into the conclusions of the paper. However, the summary paragraph on p. 23 and Figure 3, focusing on critical consciousness, cooperation skills, language proficiency and content knowledge, now seem to me appropriate as a comprehensive picture.
2. The concept of critical consciousness has been further explained. As the authors clarify in their reply, "While interculturality covers aspects of promoting cultural awareness, critical consciousness addresses ideological stances and advocacy regarding culture and language". The ideological connotation of their concept of cultural consciousness is what makes me suspicious. My problem is not that this concept is addressed in the review, but that the authors themselves seem to take an ideological position. That makes this review a position paper. For instance, the discussion on p. 25 emphasizes the importance of "language ideologies" as part of the competences of bilingual education teachers. The authors cite Sierens et al. (2018) who refer to appropriate interventions as fostering "positive attitudes towards linguistic diversity and more favourable perceptions of diverse languages" (p. 25). As I already explained in my previous comments on D-22-0030R1, a position paper, how valuable in itself, is something different in comparison with a review study. My conclusion is that there exists a disagreement between the authors and this reviewer. It is up to the Editor to decide in this matter. My idea is that the authors rightfully address the issue of critical consciousness in their review, and may provide an overview of the various positions put forward in the papers included in the review. But the authors should refrain from taking a stance themselves. Their task is not to persuade the reader but to provide  data (in this case: points of view on what critical consciousness should entail) which help the reader  to better understand the concept of critical consciousness as part of the competences of bilingual education teachers. 
3. There are many instances of at least confusion about who is speaking: the authors of papers reviewed or the authors of the review. For instance on p.16:  "This shortcoming is especially important as minority language preservation is a goal of bilingual education (Wright & Baker, 2017)", "Beyond that, bilingual teacher education must counteract English language hegemony, reaffirm language varieties and foster the development of both languages, for example through translanguaging (Szwed & Gonz√°lez-Carriedo, 2019)". Are these statements reflecting the view of the authors of the review or the view of the authors of the papers reviewed, or both?
4. My third comment in the previous review has been adequately addressed. However, I noticed a new problematic concept (for me as reviewer): "subtractive language orientations in U.S. schools" (p. 14). My understanding of the term "subtractive" is definitely inappropriate in this context.
5. There are still a few minor points. On p. 7, "(see Figure 1)" should read "(see Figure 2)". On p. 30, "context" on the forelast line should read "contexts". In general, the abundant use of abbreviations may lower the readability of the paper. "CC", for instance, could easily be changed into "critical consciousness". 
To conclude, apart from the issue of critical consciousness, I am satisfied with the current revision of the paper. But as I oppose to the way the concept of critical consciousness has been dealt with, I unfortunately have to advise to reject the paper.
