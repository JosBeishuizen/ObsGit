Manuscript EDUREV-D-24-00433 entitled "A Meta-Analysis on the Relation between Embodied Learning and Academic Achievement" entails a review of 234 studies into the effect of embodied learning on academic achievement. The topic of this review study is definitely relevant for the Journal. In general, the paper has been clearly written, although typos and grammatical errors, like mismatches between subject and verb in a sentence, have to be corrected. My major problems with the paper have to do with the content of the introduction, the nature of independent variable embodied learning, the selection of papers, and the discussion of the findings. Therefore, I unfortunately have to propose rejection of the paper. I will explain my issues. 

The content of the introduction. At a surface level, many sentences are difficult to grasp. To give a few examples. Taken from the Abstract: "Pedagogical practices across diverse disciplines can benefit from this theory, as it facilitates students' understanding...". How can a theory facilitate students' understanding? A theory may offer an explanation which helps us to understand why actions and sensory experiences help students to grasp the meaning of abstract concepts. But that is not what the text says. The first sentence of the Introduction: "The connection between the body and the environment contributes to cognitive formation". What is meant by cognitive formation? And what is meant by the connection between the body and the environment?  The last sentence of the first paragraph: "Furthermore, embodied learning is increasingly becoming a focal point in education, highlighting its growing importance in shaping effective teaching methodologies (Kosmas & Zaphiris, 2020). Such a strong claim should be elaborated and underpinned. This is only the first paragraph of the Introduction. I could go on and on, identifying sentences and statements which I find difficult to understand. There is not an easy solution to this problem. Perhaps it helps to ask a critical friend to scrutinize the text in order to identify difficult sentences and statements. Two specific theories are, in my view, misinterpreted. First, Piagets theory of cognitive development. Piaget emphasizes that sensorimotor activities are the very point of departure of intelligence. In no way can his theory lead to the conclusion that embodied learning becomes more relevant when students enter the phase of abstract reasoning. It is the other way around. Secondly, cognitive load theory does not predict that prolonged intervention duration makes working memory ineffective at processing new information. Task complexity may indeed overload working memory, but not intervention duration as such. 

The nature of the independent variable. The paper does not contain a definition of embodied learning. This makes it very difficult to understand the applied methodology: computing correlation coefficients between embodied learning and academic achievement. I have difficulty envisaging what is meant a high amount or a low amount of embodied learning. Let alone the distinction between strong and weak embodied learning. As explained on p. 17 (my numbering, my copy of the paper did not contain page numbers), selected studies employed experimental or quasi-experimental designs. I would expect an analysis of effect sizes but not correlation coefficients. Now, Table 3 on p. 25 contains a column header "Effect size (Correlation)". So perhaps, the authors have indeed focussed on effect sizes in their meta-analysis. But then, they should consequently use the label "effect size" in their explanation of the results. 

The selection of papers. On p. 16 and 17 the authors describe the terms they have used for the literature search. The chosen terms are very diverse (from "embod*" to "music" and "dance"). This makes me suspicious about the heterogeneity of the sample. In Figure 1 (p. 18) we learn that 2133 articles were excluded because they were not related to the field of education. This step has not been explained in the text. Given the search terms, it is difficult to believe that roughly 37% of the selected papers were not related to the field of education. 

The discussion of the findings. The discussion paragraph contains a rather mechanical discussion of the moderator variables and the interaction effects. The interpretation of the findings and the examples provided are not based on the papers included in the sample. There is no story, let alone of a theory of embodied learning developed. So, the reader basically ends with a set of moderate effect sizes and the recommendation to integrate embodied learning in his or her education. That is a rather modest result of the review study.
