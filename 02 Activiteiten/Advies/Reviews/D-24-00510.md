- Manuscript D-24-00510 entitled "Making masterâ€™s thesis writing a journey of mastery: A systematic review" reports on a systematic review of 37 papers on writing a master's thesis. The paper is well structured and clearly written. The topic does fit into the scope of the Journal.  
- The authors have organized their findings in a descriptive framework addressing the stages of preparing and writing a thesis and addressing the outcomes of the thesis writing endeavour (which, by the way, is not a stage in thesis writing but a product of thesis writing). With a focus on the student as the main actor in producing a master's thesis.  This does make sense and provides a useful overview of factors contributing to the success of writing a thesis.
- Having said that, there are a few concerns which the authors may address.
- First, the size of the sample. The sample is not very big, 37 papers in total. That in itself is not a major  problem but the heterogeinity of the sample does raise some questions. As Figure D in Appendix A shows, 10 papers study thesis writing in the science domain (various subjects), the domain of 13 papers is described as "mixed", and another 13 papers are taken from the humanities domain, with the domain of one paper described as "not specified". In the academic world of this reviewer (my country was not included in the sample, as Figure B shows), writing a master's thesis in the science domain is a completely different process compared with thesis writing in the humanities domain. Science theses are usually short and following the format and guidelines of academic journals. Humanities theses often follow the format of traditional monographs, more chapters, more pages. Sciences theses are usually embedded in ongoing research programmes. Often, topics are chosen by the supervisors to contribute to these programmes. In the humanities, students often have more freedom to develop their own topic and research questions. Again, this is part of the academic tradition in my country, and may not hold for the UK or Finland, the countries in which, according to Figure B in Appendix A, 16 of the 37 selected papers were situated. Given the restricted size of the  sample,  my question is whether conclusions can be drawn which hold for which domains of thesis writing?
- My second issue has to do with the kind of conclusions and recommdendations the authors are presenting. In general, positive relationships between factors and thesis writing activities and outcomes are presented, resulting in a lot of "shoulds" (14) and "needs to" (6).  Inevitably,  some of these recommendations are well known to the reader, out of his or her own experience.  So, the paper suffers from the "nothing new" problem. I would suggest two ways to overcome this problem. In the first place, the authors might consider to present characteristic diffficulties in the process of thesis writing, related to each of the topics in their framework, provided of course that the selected papers report about these difficulties, and how to overcome them. That would definitely contribute the value of the paper.  In the second place, the authors might consider adding characteristic examples of factors influencing the process of thesis writing. That would make the paper more lively and would also enable readers to the connect the findings to their own experience as supervisors.
- To sum  up,  my advise is to reject the paper and encourage the authors address the issues raised above.
