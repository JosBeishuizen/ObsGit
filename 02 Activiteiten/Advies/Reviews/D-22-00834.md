A. De theoretische context wordt geschetst in Figuur 1: het multilayer model. Dit is op zichzelf geen diepgaand model maar het zou als kapstok kunnen dienen om de bevindingen te ordenen. Maar dat gebeurt eigenlijk niet. Daar gaat het alleen om het beantwoorden van de twee onderzoeksvragen: outcomes, en factoren die van invloed zijn. De learning activities: acquisition, application, deep learning, self-regulated, externally regulated, multiple learners. De outcomes worden in de resultatensectie verder onderverdeeld in satisfaction, knowledge, skills, attitudes, practice and intentions for practice. En dat dan op docentniveau en op studentniveau, daar komt Figuur 1 weer om de hoek kijken. Dit is geen sterke theoretische context. 
Congruence? Waar hoort dit bij?
Dat heeft consequenties voor de beschrijving van de uitkomsten en het naar voren halen van de belangrijkste uitkomsten.
Je kunt ook aansluiten bij de core features zie Desimone (2009), Borko et al. (2010) (p. 2)

B. Is de waarde van review goed aangegeven? Previous syntheses of research in teacher prof. dev. have not explicitly focused on the innovative context. 

C. Is het veld rijp voor een review? Field is still maturing (kijk naar de theoretical underpinnings van de PDI's). Knowledge in the field is fragmented. Borko zegt: modelling of practices, professional learning communities, collaborative learning practices, dat werkt!

D. Wat is bekend en wat moet nog uitgezocht worden?
Previous research provides some evidence of effective factors of professional development (abstract). Desimone (2009): core features: content focus, active learning, coherence with teachers' beliefs, sufficient duration, collective participation. Borko et al. (2010): content of professional development should be situated in practice, focus on student learning, and model preferred practices. Je moet ook rekening houden met teacher learning --> multilayer model. Dynamic relation between teacher and student learning. 
Stes (p.4): longer initiatives had more impact. De Rijdt et al (2013): no single recipe. Several characteristics of the learner, the intervention, and the work environment, that facilitate transfer. Ilie et al. (2020): single disciplines, mandatory participation, shorter PDI's (instead of longer PDI's). Van innocation weten we niets af. Nieuwe skills! Innovation: new aspect in the educational environment, departure from what has been done before (Hannan et al., 1999). Congruence: new teaching methods modelled during PDI. Theoretische funderingen van de PDI: reflectie, communities of practices (p14). 

E. Wat zijn de beantwoordbare vragen?
First, to provide an overview of the different ways professional develoment is utilised to support higher education teachers during innovations,
Second, to find evidence for factors that facilitate or inhibit teacher learning and development during different professional development initiatives.
Wat zijn de antwoorden? Beschrijving in de categorieën van teacher learning and outcomes, student learning & outcomes. Worden we niet wijzer van!
Factors facilitation or inhibiting: Tabel 12.
Factors related to PD design: learning activities: feedback, autonomy for participants, congruence through learning in practice. collaboration, repeated sessions (?). Materials not useful, lack of practice, duration (too short), lack of teamwork skills, group formation. 
Eerste punt is geen vraag, maar een actie: overview verschaffen. Zie niet goed wat de betekenis van de opbrengst is: zie p25
Tweede punt: Succesfactoren. Geen one size fits all success factor. Feedback, support & resources (tijd/workload, leadership buy in, access to functional IT, low status for teaching. Communication, empowerment. 
Congruence is een zeldzaamheid. Jammer want het is zo nuttig! learners "have the opportunity to both perform and experience an outcome" (Hutton, 1989). 
Conclusies: congruence is belangrijk, feedback and sufficient support (p29).

### Representativiteit van de steekproef
All databases, no date restrictions, 773 hits. Ik geloof dat het wel klopt. Wel een vraag: wat is nu precies het analysis framework (p10). 

### Kleine zaken
Author=paper?
Instructors≠teachers? (p15) p24: teachers or instructors?
Wat doen we met tabel 6, 7?
Drie soorten innovaties: technologisch, student focused, alle andere (p13). Betekenis van deze indeling?
zin onderaan p27
Titel erg lang

## Mijn commentaar

Manuscript D-22-00834 entitled  "Towards a better understanding of teacher learning and development in the context of innovations in higher education" provides "an overview of the different ways professional development is utilised to support higher education teachers during innovations" and identifies "factors that facilitate or inhibit teacher learning and development during different professional development initiatives". The topic of the manuscript is interesting and relevant for the Journal. The paper is well structured and well written. A lot of studies have been synthesized, so there is enough potential to arrive at a valuable review. However, in its current form, the outcomes of the review do not stand out is very remarkable or informative. In order to analyze whether the paper might be improved I follow Alexander's (2020) recommendations to arrive at high quality systematic reviews. I have deduced five questions from Alexander (2020, Table 1). The idea is that answers to these questions have to be found in the manuscript.

a. How is the review theoretically situated?
Here, we encounter a major drawback of the paper. The theoretical framework has not been clearly presented in the Introduction. Table 1, the multilayer model, is a good point of departure.  However, what is meant by  teacher/student learning processes and outcomes is explained in the Results section by specifying "categories" of learning (acquisition, application, etc.) and outcomes (satisfaction, knowledge, skills, etc.). These "categories" are, evidently, not randomly chosen, but represent a theory of learning by students and teachers, which should be outlined in the Introduction, and which should serve as a context of interpretation of the findings. Currently, the Results section, particularly the description of Professional Development Initiatives, is indeed very descriptive. The reader may doubt whether he or she has to learn the presented findings by heart in order to benefit from the insight the paper offers. A more advanced theoretical framework serves as a structure in which the findings become meaningful. My advice is to reconsider the presentation of the theoretical framework in order to strengthen the presentation of the findings. 

b. Have the merits of the review been demonstrated, both theoretically and practically?
Unfortunately, for me as a reviewer, the merits of the review have not been clearly articulated. The theoretical qualities of the paper have already been discussed above. But I would also like to draw the attention of the authers to the practical value of the review. What are the characteristics of the intended audience? If practitioners belong to the target audience, for instance designers of professional development initiatives, then the authors should identify what, for these designers, the lessons to be learned are. The Discussion and Conclusion section is not very rich as far as practical implications are concerned (no one size fits al solution, feedback is important, support and resources are important). 

c. What is the maturity of the field of inquiry?
This is of course a question to be answered before the review is initiated. The authors are hesitant themselves. They state that "the field is still maturing" (fragmented knowledge, various theoretical underpinnings). The authors recommend to take advantage of work that has been done in the domain of elementary and secondary education (Desimone, 2009; Borko et al., 2010). My problem is that the current review does not provide considerable theoretical structure in this rather unstructured field. I am convinced that the authors are able to articulate their theoretical ideas to such an extent that the maturing field indeed does benefit from the review.

d. What is known and what has to be find out?
The authors do summarize relevant findings by Desimone (2009), Borko et al. (2010), Stes et al. (2010), De Rijdt et al. (2013). These findings may gain in relevance and meaning when they are situated in a clear theoretical framework (once again...). 

e. Have answerable questions been articulated?
The last question is perhaps the most important. Answerable questions lead to meaningful answers. My advice is to reconsider the first research question ("What kinds of professional development initiatives...") in order to provide insights which are valuable for both theory and practice. A descriptive summary of 68 papers does in itself not serve such a purpose. The second research question (factors which facilitate or inhibit) is appropriate, and does in fact lead to the most interesting findings in the Results section. 

A few minor points:
- The title is rather long, a shorter version is thinkable.
- The term "authors"  is used to refer to "papers", as far as I understand. I have no objections, but it would be helpful the inform the reader.
- Tables 6 - 12 are relatively underexplained in the text. The authors may consider restricting the number of tables. 

To summarize, my advice is to revise the paper. As I said, the authors have collected a lot of interesting studies, which, undoubtedly, can be analyzed to arrive at a valuable and useful paper.
