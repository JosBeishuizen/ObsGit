Manuscript D-23-00837, entitled "A SystematicReview of Data Literacy of K-12 School Principals" addresses the question "what constitutes principals' data literacy". A systematic review has been carried out to answer this question. The job has been done in a clear and careful way, the paper itself has been written very clearly. My compliments to the authors! The data are interesting in themselves and may serve to answer a "critical question", which has not been answered but is answerable, given the current status of the research  in the domain of interest. The qualifications in the previous sentence are taken from Alexander's (2020) paper on the quality of systematic reviews. To my regret, the paper under review does not contain such a critical question. There is no theoretical positioning of the paper. Therefore, the review in its current form is purely descriptive, which makes it very difficult to figure out which findings are transient and which conclusions are remarkable or unexpected. Again, there is no theoretical framework to interpret the findings.

The definition of principals' data literacy provided on p. 17 as an outcome is a good example. First of all, the definition should be included in the Introduction as a point of departure, together with the four distinct features, as explained on p. 18. But the definition also clarifies a more fundamental issue I have with  the purpose of this review. Replace the word "data" in the definition with "language" and you end up with a definition that completely makes sense. Language is a medium by which particular goals may be served. By the same token, "data" may be used to served particular purposes. The purposes are interesting and worth discussing, not the means.

For instance, the discussion on various leadership roles on p. 19 is interesting and may be the focus of a review on the question how principals make use of "data" to enact various roles in schools, like the ones discussed on p. 19. 

Another instance is the relationship between principals, teachers and student outcomes, as discussed on p. 16. This might be a focus for a review study into the way principals use data to foster student learning. 

A minor issue I have with the paper is the K-12 scope of the review. The authors address this point in the limitations paragraph, but that does not solve the problem for me. At least in my country, running a primary school is completely different from being in charge of a secondary school. Also in the context of the problem of this review.

Based on the previous considerations, my advise is to reject the paper. But I would also like to encourage the authors to reflect on my thoughts, and perhaps rearrange their collected data in such a way that they can answer some unanswered bu answerable questions.
