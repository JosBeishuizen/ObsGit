Manuscript D-23-00346, entitled "Systematic review of empirical research on teachers' professional communities" starts with the observation that there exists a "lack of conceptual clarity about what constitutes a teacher community" (Abstract). Therefore, the review study has been focussed on the question "How do empirical studies conceptualise and operationalise teacher communities for professional development?" (p. 4, my numbering, my copy of the manuscript does not contain page numbers).  This issue is relevant for the Journal. My advice is "major revisions". 

The paper is well designed but often difficult to understand. Arguments are sometimes complex. A few examples. "The difficulties in conceptualizing communities also arise from the different relationships of these constructs to the theoretical ideas such as social and situated learning, learning in practice (W. Roth & Lee, 2006; Vangrieken et al., 2017; Wubbels, 2007), and the evolution of the theory from a lens to a tool for learning (Li et al., 2009) that have different implications for research;" (p. 3). "The difficulty in pinpointing the exact definition of a community may also be due to the use of the concept as a symbolic boundary line between groups of people who share certain commonalities in culture, behaviour, and perceived selfidentity (Cohen, 1985)." (p. 4). "Two studies used the TC frameworks interchangeably, for example, one construct was used as a framework to design a professional learning group but used a different TC theory as an analytical tool to interpret findings" (sentence grammatically incorrect, p. 7). "In our sample, we identified 10 studies that defined community as concepts related to social or collective learning (marked with an asterisk in table 2). (incorrect sentence, p. 8). "Most studies on teacher communities were interested in understanding the social, situated, collective or collaborative learning dynamics; the impact of teacher communities on teachers' professional development, their subject knowledge, and their pedagogical skills; and the effects of these communities as interventions rather than aiming to understand the teacher community itself. (sentence is correct but could be simplified, p. 16). 

My major issue with the paper has to do with both the endeavour itself to define the concept of teacher communities and with the choice of two theoretical frameworks, the "theory" of Professional Learning Communities and the "theory" of Communities of Practice. Defining a diffuse concept like teacher communities may prove unsuccessful. Perhaps, various examples of teacher communities share overlapping similarities but cannot be identified with a set of defining characteristics (like Wittgenstein's family resemblances). The aforementioned theoretical frameworks are diffuse in themselves, and not properly explained or elaborated in the manuscript. Perhaps, the authors might choose operational definitions as a better level of abstraction to characterise various examples of teacher communities. Already in 2012, Admiraal, Lockhorst, and Van der Pol proposed three characteristics of communities as defining: common goals, shared values, shared interactional repertoire. The choice for these characteristics might be outdated or obsolete, but they form a more appropriate point of departure for a review study than the vague and abstract notions of Professional Learning Communities and Communities of Practice. Moreover, the two notions appear highly overlapping. Therefore, it is difficult to relate a particular definition or operationalisation to either one of the two notions or the other. 

In the paper, it remains unclear what the relationship is between community indicators and operational definitions. This should be clarified to understand the findings of the review. 

The Discussion section contains some recommendations which do not appear te be related to the outcomes of the review study. I am referring to the advice to involve teachers in the process of designing teacher communities. I am unable to trace this recommendation to any of the findings in the Results section. The same goes for the advice to design teacher communities in a "democratic" way. It is not completely clear what the authors mean with "democratic"  in this context, and why this advice should be followed up, given the findings in the Results section. 

My last comment has to do with the size of the sample of 32 papers included in the review. The sample size is not impressive, but more importantly, it is not clear why the chosen time frame is so narrow. The Vangrieken review study had a different focus, so there is no reason to follow up on that study. The Admiraal et al. paper I mentioned above dates from 2012. There are definitely many papers dealing with teacher communities and trying to identify defining characteristics since then. 

In sum, my advice is to reconsider the level of abstraction at which definitions and operationalisations of the concept of teacher communities are compared and contrasted, to extend the time frame of the selection procedure, to formulate recommendations which can be deduced from the findings of the review, and to pay attention to the readability of the revised manuscript.
