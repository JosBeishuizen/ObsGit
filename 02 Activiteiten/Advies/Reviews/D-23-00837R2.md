# D-23-00837R2
In manuscript D-23-00837R2, the authors have further accommodated the manuscript to the comments of the reviewers. I am now fully convinced that the paper contains valuable insights which may help school leaders to prepare for their job or further develop their leadership skills. On top of that, the paper may serve as a poimt of departure for further studying the way school leaders make use of information technology in their demanding tasks and responsabilities. Addressing the four issues I raised in my previous review.

The relevance of the critical question, which elements of data literacy are unique to principals and which elements are shared by principals and teachers, has been adequately explained in the Discussion section. I am completely satisfied by the changes made.

The position of "our definition of pincipals' data literacy" has been clarified and related to the findings in Table 3 and Figure 3. There is a new issue, however: on p. 11, the readers do not yet understand what "Dimensions 1 & 2" etc. mean. So, a proper reference to Table 3 and Figure 3 has to be added. 

The role of expectations (p. 17) has been properly explained by the newly added paragraph on p. 17.

The difference between the tasks of principals in primary and secondary has been adequately clarified on p. 12.

I found one typo on p. 26, a mismatch between subject and verb: "highlights" --> "highlight"

I congratulate the authors with their work and with the substantial and valuable manuscript they produced!
