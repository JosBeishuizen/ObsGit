The authors made a thorough attempt to meet the comments of the reviewers. Although they made substantial progress, I am still not completely convinced that the paper should be published. My advice is major revision, based on the following comments.

1. The paper now contains a theoretical framework which has a sound foundation in the existing literature and really helps to organize the findings collected by the authors. So, that is a major step forward. However, the authors are advised to go one step further in order to create a comprehensive picture of the competences of bilingual education teachers. Currently, it is still a rather abstract collection of characteristics. For instance, what kind of assessment would the authors administer whenever they had to figure out whether a language teacher is fit for bilingual education? Which linguistic competences would they test, how would they assess the teacher's critical consciousness, what kind of cooperation skills would they assess, and how would they identify the teacher's knowledge of bilingual education research. Such an assessment would of course form the point of departure of training programme to prepare language teachers to start with bilingual education. Thinking of such an imaginary assessment might help the authors to create a comprehensive and characteristic picture of the competences of bilingual education teachers as it arises from the papers reviewed. 

2.  My second issue has to do with the concept of critical consciousness. In itself, the label "critical consciousness" or abbreviated as CC is rather meaningless. Other terms, like cultural awareness, are more to the point. Then, there is a difference between, on the one hand, awareness of cultural differences and the role of students' mother tongue as they develop their identity in an environment where other languages are dominant, and, on the other hand,  the ideological point of view that students should be taught to use the dominant language, or should be able to use their mother tongue, or whatever stance in between. For instance, on p. 17 the authors discuss "problematic beliefs and resultating discrimination". It is not clear whether this ideological stance is the authors' view or the voice of the reviewed papers. I would advocate to emphasize the need to foster bilingual education teachers' awareness of these cultural issues, without taking position as authors of the review study. A position paper, how valuable in itself, is something else in comparison with a review study. 

3.  There are still some concepts which need clarification. The word "framework" is now used for both the overarching theoretical framework, and for individual frameworks or profiles (p. 12), competence frameworks (p. 9), frameworks (plural, p. 13).
     The "surplus"  concept on p. 24 is still obscure for this reviewer. 
     
4. A few minor comments:
	a. The title may be reduced to "A Systematic Review ..." . The first part of the current title is a bit overdone. 
	b. Under "3. Results" (p. 8) the reference to Figure 1 should be changed to Figure 2.
	c. Figure 3 needs a better introduction on p. 11.
	d. The paragraphs on language proficience tests (p. 15, 16) may be removed, they are a bit outside the scope of this review.
