Manuscript D-22-00543, entitled "Identifying Pre- and Inservive Teachers' Stances in Teaching Socioscientific Issues: A Systematic Review of the Research", provides a review of studies into the way teachers introduce controversial issues in their classrooms, in particular their views on their own position in and contribution to the teaching of these issues. The topic is interesting and relevant for the Journal. The manuscript is well structured and well written. However, my advice is to reject the paper. The reason is that I conclude from the paper that the field of research has not been developed to such an extent that reviewing makes sense. The paper lacks a clear theoretical framework, the scope of the review is not clearly defined, and the sample of selected papers is too small. Let me explain this.

a. The introduction does not contain a clear theoretical framework leading to a set of research questions which enable the authors to deepen our understanding of teachers' views on how to address the teaching of controversial or "socioscientifc" issues. In fact, the Table on p. 12 (which accidentally does not have a number) contains a framework. The authors state om p.  10 that they "created the themes and categories as seen in Table 3", apparently after analysing the 18 included papers. It is unclear how this process of creation took place. There must be links to the existing literature which make the list of stances - excluders, neutrals, disclosers - and the list of justifications plausible. Such a theoretically embedded framework might serve as a point of departure for a systematic review to refine the conceptualisations in the framework. The current list of 5 research questions on p. 7 is just an open overview of possible angles (methods, teacher characteristics, geographical characteristics). Moreover, the relevance of the distinction between pre-service and in-service teachers has not been made clear. I can imagine all kinds of differences between these two groups of teachers. But for the purpose of analysing teachers' views on addressing controversial issues the teachers' experience may service as a major source of inspiration. Therefore, my choice would be to focus on experienced teachers. But the point is that considerations like these are simply not provided. The same goes for including geographical backgrounds in the research questions. The political context, like freedom of speech, much be an important determinant of teachers' attitudes towards introducing controversial issues in the classroom. In this respect, comparing Turkish and Western studies might be valuable. However, the Turkish context has been dramatically changed in recent years. Again, this issue has not been addressed in the manuscript. 

b.  The scope of the review has not been clearly defined. To me, combining studies in primary and secondary education does not seem appropriate for the purpose of this review. The age of the students appears to be a major determinant for choosing a strategy to address controversial issues. Secondly, it is not clear why the focus should be restricted to science issues. In the Netherlands, discussing the Holocaust is a major problem for many secondary school teachers, because students from various backgrounds tend to deny the reality of the Holocaust. So, it appears more important to distinguish between issues which, according to the teachers, have a firm scientific basis, and issues which are more open to debate, even within science. Then, the teachers' stance may be the result of an interaction between the teachers' belief in the trustworthiness of the underlying evidence of a particular issue and the teachers' pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs. Apart from the diversity of the students and the political context. Taking these variables into account leads to a different definition of the scope of the review. Of course, the authors are free to define their own variables to consider. My point is that they provides no arguments to delineate their review study. 

c. As said before, the sample of papers included in the review is too small and too heterogeneous to allow conclusions to be drawn. The authors acknowledge this as a major limitation of the study. To me, this characteristic makes the review not suited for publication. 

d. As a consequence of what has been put forward, the five conclusions on p. 28 and 29 are not very ground-breaking. Teachers can change their points of view and strategies.  Teacher may adopt various strategies to achieve a shared goal. Experienced teachers differ from student teachers. What teachers report in questionnaires does not necessarily reflect their behaviour in the classroom. One conclusion stands out: When introducing the issues of evolution and climate change teachers try to stay as closely to the facts as possible (my words). This is interesting because it sheds some light on the interaction between teachers' views on the veridicality of scientific evidence underlying a particular issue and their pedagogical approaches.
