Manuscript D-23-01039, entitled "Pre-service mathematics teachers' professional identities A systematic literature review", adresses the concept of teacher identity, in particular the emerging identity of pre-service math teachers. The paper seeks to identify characteristics of pre-service math teachers' professional identity and aims to summarize the findings of recent relevant papers. 

The subject of this review is relevant and potentially urgent. The paper is clearly structured and well written, although some comments about structure and style have been, see below (comment 7). However, various considerations lead me to the advice to reject the paper. 

1 As the authors emphasize in the Abstract, the findings presented in the paper fall "short of presenting a comprehensive portrayal of the complex journey toward becoming a professional mathematics teacher¨. That is unfortunate because the main goal of presenting a review study is exactly to offer a comprehensive portrayal of major trends in the reviewed studies. So, the outcomes of this review study are indeed below the expectations of this rviewer.

2 It is not surprising that the authors are unsuccessful in bringing together insights from 23 collected papers on the emergent professional identity of pre-service math teachers. The point is that no theory about teacher identitities is presented. Consequently, the research questions (1. How is pre-service math teacher identity conceptualized; and 2. What are the findings of the studies) do not provide enough structure or direction to guide both the reviewers and the readers. One could envisage an elaboration of Beijaard's concept of professional identity with three dimensions (domain expertise, pedagogical expertise and didactical expertise), as explained on p. 7, in the direction of the emergent or developing professional identity of pre-service math teachers. About these three dimensions various findings are reported. But there is no coherence in the presentation of the results because the authors have not conceptualized themselves how math teacher identities might develop in the course of their professional growth. There is a lot of literature dealing with this development. For instance, about the interaction between personal development and professional learning, but there are many other issues at stake here, to choose from. The paper really needs more reflection, more hypotheses to be put to the test by confronting them with the actual findings in the collected studies. 

3 The description of the methods is clear and concise, but the frequent use of the pronoun "I" does raise questions about the reliability of the process. Usually, various researchers work in parallel, comparing and contrasting their work to arrive at a reliable
product. What did the authors do to guarantee that the review procedure has been completed in a reliable way?

4 As par. 2.3.1. explains, the collected studies investigated pre-service mathematics teachers' identity in "elementary-, middle-, or high-school education programs encompassing both standalone mathematics teaching and broader generalist teaching roles". In the country of this reviewer, primary school teachers and secondary school teachers are educated in completely different curricula. Indeed, primary school teachers are generalists and secondary school teachers are math specialists. Also the pupils or students these teachers are preparing for, differ in every respect. So, in my view, it is not advised to include studies about both types of teachers in one sample. 

5 Because of the lack of theoretical background in the Introduction (see above), the Results section contains many truisms which are very difficult to contradict. To mention a few: "The reviewed studies demonstrate that the conceptualization of pre-service mathematics teacher identity is not a monolithic construct. It is rather a multifaceted concept and its manifestations vary across different contexts depending on prior experiences and expectations of the future self as a mathematics teacher." (conclusion of par. 3.1.1. on p. 8). It is difficult to envisage an author in this domain claiming that the concept of math teacher identity is indeed a "monolithic construct". And if such a view does exist, it might be interesting to present it in the Introduction as an hypothesis to be tested. Another example: "The reviewed studies indicate that attitudes toward mathematics and beliefs about teaching mathematics are crucial for the identity process of becoming a mathematics teacher." (conclusion of par. 3.2.1. on p. 10). Again: who claims that these attitudes and beliefs are not crucial for the identity process? Last example: "The reviewed studies indicate that pedagogical considerations can be in conflict with each other because teachers’ own prior experiences are not in line with the expectations from teacher education and other demands from society" (conclusion of par. 3.2.2. on p. 11). The "can be" construction makes this conclusion rather obvious. 

6 The Discussion section contains normative statements, which do not necessarily follow from the collected data, especially in the context of discussing the differences between so-called traditional teaching approaches and reform-based teaching approaches on p. 14. The implicit assumption is that reform-based pedagogies are better than traditional pedagogies. Apart from the rather imprecise definition of both approaches, the collected data do not warrant the conclusion that one approach is better than the other. 

7 Some explanations are difficult to understand. To mention a few: (1) the methods "rehabilitation and bibliotherapy" mentioned on 3.1. on p. 6, (2) the illustration povided by Lutovac and Kaasila (2012) about past, present and future mathematical identities "[that] enter into a dialogue which leads to one’s awareness of the tension between the present and ideal state of mathematical identity” on p. 8 (this is a quote, but nonetheless difficult to grasp), (3) "The conceptualization of identity in the studies, as derived from the two identified themes mentioned above, centers around the concept of pre-service teacher identity in general, to which mathematical identity is then added. Omitting the subject of teaching, such as mathematics, from the concept of pre-service teacher identity overlooks a crucial contextual foundation, by treating the subject context as an aspect external to one’s identity as a future mathematics teacher. Some of the reviewed studies (e.g., Lutovac & Kaasila, 2012) propose a solution for integrating the concept of pre-service teacher identity with that of mathematical identity. This proposal involves connecting the two distinct concepts of pre-service teacher identity and mathematical identity" on p. 12 (a very diffcult paragraph). Perhaps, the authors might consider asking a critical friend to scrutinize the paper.
