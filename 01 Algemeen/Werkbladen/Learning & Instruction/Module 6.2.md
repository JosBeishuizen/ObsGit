	The next video is a rather lengthy introduction into the most important theories about the way motivation influences learning. It may help you to check your notes on the relevance of motivation in your own research. The more elaborate you have considered the concept of motivation in the context of your own research, the more you may benefit from the introduction in the next video. Try to identify three or four theoretical concepts or theories which further detail how motivation influences the learning performance of your participants. Focus your attention on these concepts as you find your way through this  module on learning and motivation.
