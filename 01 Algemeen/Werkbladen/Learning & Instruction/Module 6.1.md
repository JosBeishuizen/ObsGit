Mijn tekst
	Learning and motivation are closely interrelated, that is what this module intends to show and explain.  Do you see links yourself? Perhaps  in your own research? 
	
	How do you take motivation into account when you provide instruction in your experiments? Write down the measures you take to assess or foster the motivation of your participants. Return to your notes at the end of this module to see whether the module provided some background notions to better understand how motivation and learning are interrelated in your research.
