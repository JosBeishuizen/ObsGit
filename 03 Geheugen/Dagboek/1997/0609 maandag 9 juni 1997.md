TORONTO (June 7, 1997 1:37 p.m. EDT) – She’s best known to the world as a naked little girl, screaming in pain and terror on a highway in Vietnam. She looks so different now, a proud mother trading grins with her 3-year-old son. On June 8, 1972, Phan Thi Kim Phuc and her family were taking refuge in a Buddhist pagoda when their village was hit by napalm bombs dropped by South Vietnamese warplanes acting on U.S. orders. One bomb struck the pagoda, killing two of Kim Phuc’s brothers and setting her clothes on fire. Ripping the clothes off, she ran down the road. A photograph of the 9-year-old girl fleeing in agony won a Pulitzer Prize for Associated Press photographer Nick Ut and helped turn American public opinion against the war. Though that photograph remains one of the most indelible images of war, Kim Phuc—who now lives in Toronto with her husband and son—has committed herself to preaching forgiveness.”Even though I suffered physically and emotionally, I’m happy, because I’m living without hatred,” she said in an interview. Her life has taken several twists since the attack on her village of Trang Bang. In 1984, communist officials summoned her to Ho Chi Minh City to be used in propaganda films. In 1986 she went to Cuba to study pharmacology and met Huy Toan, who became her husband. The two accepted an invitation to spend their honeymoon in Russia, then they successfully sought asylum as refugees in 1992 when their jet stopped for fuel in Canada on the way back to Cuba. They lived on welfare for two years, but now are making do with Huy Toan’s earnings as a counselor for handicapped adults. A book project is in the works, and Kim Phuc is an active member of a Baptist church. She is expecting a second child in August, and for now is kept busy by her son Thomas, a cheerful boy who speaks Vietnamese, English and a smattering of Spanish. Her parents still live in Trang Bang, and she would like to find the money to bring them to Toronto for a visit. During her first two years in Canada, Kim Phuc kept a low profile, but she returned to the public eye last year, laying a wreath at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington as part of a Veterans Day observance. ”If I could talk face to face with the pilot who dropped the bomb, I would tell him we cannot change history but we should try to do things for the present and for the future to promote peace,” she said then. After the ceremony, the American who ordered the attack on her village emerged from the crowd, embraced Kim Phuc and sobbed, “I’m so sorry.”

“It’s all right,” she told John Plummer. “I forgive, I forgive.”
