Hello from the cold and rainy Finland,
Thanks very much for the articles you sent me. I will read them carefully.
It was also pleasure meeting you in Athens!
Wishing you a good autumn,
Sirpa

Dear Sirpa,
Thanks again for your kind comments on my poster at the EARLI meeting. It is amazing how a few friendly words during a brief encounter can rest in your consciousness as a happy remembrance. We enjoy a sort of Indian summer here in Holland.
Best wishes, Jos

Hi again,
I know how you feel. I just finished a course with psychology students
where we used ALEL computer programm for teaching research methodology.
After the course one man comes to me and says: ‘This has been great! I
learned a lot!’. It is great to get those comments. 
We should just learn to give good feedback (it is so easy not to say
anything). Giving positive comments gives a good feeling both to the
receiver and to the one who gives the feedback.
It is great to be in your happy memories.
I envy your Indian summer.
Sirpa
