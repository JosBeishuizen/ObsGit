# Converse Connie - One by one

We go walking in the dark.  
We go walking out at night.

And it's not as lovers go,  
Two by two, to and fro;  
But it's one by one -

One by one in the dark.  
We go walking out at night.

As we wander through the grass  
We can hear each other pass,  
But we're far apart -

Far apart in the dark.  
We go walking out at night.

With the grass so dark and tall  
We are lost past recall  
If the moon is down -

And the moon is down.  
We are walking in the dark.

If I had your hand in mine  
I could shine, I could shine  
Like the morning sun -  
Like the sun.
