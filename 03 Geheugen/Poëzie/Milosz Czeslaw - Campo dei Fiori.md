# Milosz Czeslaw - Campo dei Fiori
In Rome on the Campo di Fiori  
baskets of olives and lemons,  
cobbles spattered with wine  
and the wreckage of flowers.  
Vendors cover the trestles  
with rose-pink fish;  
armfuls of dark grapes  
heaped on peach-down.

On this same square  
they burned Giordano Bruno.  
Henchmen kindled the pyre  
close-pressed by the mob.  
Before the flames had died  
the taverns were full again,  
baskets of olives and lemons  
again on the vendors’ shoulders.

I thought of the Campo di Fiori  
in Warsaw by a carousel  
one clear spring evening  
to the strains of a carnival tune.  
The bright melody drowned  
the salvos from the ghetto wall,  
and couples were flying  
high in the cloudless sky.

At times wind from the burning  
would drift dark kites along  
and riders on the carousel  
caught petals in mid-air.  
That same hot wind  
blew open the skirts of the girls  
and the crowds were laughing  
on that beautiful Warsaw Sunday.

Someone will read as moral  
that the people of Rome or Warsaw  
haggle, laugh, make love  
as they pass by martyrs’ pyres.  
Someone else will read  
of the passing of things human,  
of the oblivion  
born before the flames have died.

But that day I thought only  
of the loneliness of the dying,  
of how, when Giordano  
climbed to his burning  
he could not find  
in any human tongue  
words for mankind,  
mankind who live on.

Already they were back at their wine  
or peddled their white starfish,  
baskets of olives and lemons  
they had shouldered to the fair,  
and he already distanced  
as if centuries had passed  
while they paused just a moment  
for his flying in the fire.

Those dying here, the lonely  
forgotten by the world,  
their tongue becomes for us  
the language of an ancient planet.  
Until, when all is legend  
and many years have passed  
on a new Campo di Fiori  
rage will kindle at a poet’s fire.  
(Warsaw, 1943)

translated by David Brooks and Louis Iribarne

The meaning of this poem depends on the time and place of its writing—Easter 1943, Warsaw—but also on something which not even the best translation can convey. For the original forms part of a large body of poems in Polish on the subject of the Holocaust, many of them written by non-Jews. Taken out of that context, of which the American reader can hardly be aware, it may appear as something exceptional. John Hersey in his novel The Wall, while mentioning my poem, suggests the Warsaw Ghetto as the place of its origin. In fact, the poem appeared in an underground anthology of poetry, Out of the Abyss (Z Otchlani), which was intended as a voice of human solidarity with the victims on the other side of the “wall.” Events soon added a peculiar postscript both to the anthology and to my poem: for two months the city of Warsaw was turned into ash and rubble during the summer uprising of 1944 against the Nazis, at a cost of two hundred thousand lives, mostly civilian. In October, the entire surviving population was deported. And it is impossible not to think with sadness of the mob in my poem, whose turn was to come so soon.
