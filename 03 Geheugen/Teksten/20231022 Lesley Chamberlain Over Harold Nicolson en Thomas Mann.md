Harold’s friendship with Thomas Mann (1875-1955), whom Harold called ‘one of the greatest of modern German writers’, began when the two writers met in Munich in 1929 during Harold’s lecture tour. Mann’s reputation as a novelist was already established and he would be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature later that same year.41 Reflecting on that moment some twenty years later, Harold observed:
‘It was a time when the German people were just beginning to recover from the horrors of inflation, when they were beginning even to forget their defeat in the first war and the humiliations of the Treaty of Versailles, and when it seemed as if the Weimar Republic, guided by Stresemann and assisted by a rich inflow of American loans, would after all be able to establish itself as a calm and not inefficient Social Democracy… It seemed even at that date that the decay of liberal bourgeoisie, which Mann himself had foreshadowed in his first novel, Buddenbrooks, was not now an inevitable development; and that Germany herself might settle down to a contented small-town existence, blessed with a modest but expanding economy, and enriched by a revival of music, architecture and poetry. We could not foresee that within a handful of months a wave of madness would sweep the country, that Mann himself would be driven into self-imposed exile, and that the whole of Europe would be riven by fire and slaughter.’42
Mann fled Nazi Germany in 1933 and emerged as the soul of literary opposition to Hitler.43 In Harold’s words, Mann ‘tried to convince the world of the menace underlying this insane, unscrupulous, and terribly dynamic force’.44 Mann followed Harold’s speeches and articles closely, approving of Harold’s outspoken stance against appeasement and his analyses of the political situation. Mann sought Harold’s help directly when friends and family were in political danger, and when Mann lent his name in 1944 to a collection of writers’ essays on the Nazi destruction of the Czechoslovak town of Lidice, Harold wrote a moving introduction.
Mann also valued Harold as a writer: of all the English books he’d read recently, he wrote in 1949, ‘Nicolson is my favourite – a true gentleman’.45 Mann thought of Harold as his ‘British friend’ and remembered Harold warning him off a certain common German anti-Americanism [probably in the McCarthy era]. ‘In America one has to distinguish between weather and climate. The weather is bad at the moment, but the climate is a good one.’ 46
Harold’s own admiration for Mann and his family – ‘that amazing family’47– only deepened as the years went by: Harold admired Mann’s achievements as a writer and humanist as well as his ‘dual temperament’ (and that of his children Klaus and Erica). Harold perhaps even saw Mann as a role model for how to deal with his own unusual nature: ‘As so many of the men and women who figure in his novels and short stories, Thomas Mann possesses a dual temperament…. There remained within him the conflict – which he has himself so brilliantly analysed – between the artist and the man of action, between the passive and the active, between acceptance and revolt, between conformity and eccentricity, between the tang of the Baltic winds and the sedative languors of the south…. How often did Thomas Mann… experience this isolation of the intellectual, this severance of the half-exotic from its kind’.48
